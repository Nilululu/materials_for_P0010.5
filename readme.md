## Usage

	./fullAnalysis.sh

## Input files

Every experiment has the following input files:

- `exp[X].data.csv` which contains trial info, with one trial per row.
- `exp[X].fixdur.csv` which is a list of fixation durations.
- `exp[x].fix.csv` contains the main input. This corresponds to `saccLog-processed.csv` from the original parser.
