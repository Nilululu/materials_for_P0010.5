The aim of Exp. 3 was to test whether the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is related to general level, or, which we think is the more interesting possibility, is related to the effort that is invested specifically in the eye-movement control. To this end, we compared a visual-search-only condition (cf. Exp. 1) with a dual-task condition, in which the same visual-search task was secondary to a digit-counting task.

The rationale is as follows. We assume that pupil size mostly reflects the amount of mental effort that is invested in the primary task. Therefore, if visual search is secondary, a large pupil size should not be predictive of fixations on low-salient locations, or less so. Phrased differently, we predict a weaker relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency in the dual-task, compared to the single-task condition. A secondary prediction is that the eyes should go to, on average, more salient locations in the dual-task condition, in which less mental effort is invested in eye-movement control, compared to the single-task condition.

## Methods

The methods, stimuli, and procedure were similar to that of Exp. 1, with the following exceptions. Throughout each trial, a random auditory stream of digits (1-5) was presented with an inter-digit interval of 1500 ms. In the visual-search-only condition, participants ignored the auditory stream and searched for a small 'Z' or 'H' embedded in the image. In the dual-task condition, the visual-search task was secondary, and the primary task was to count the number of times that an auditory target was presented. In both conditions, the trial ended when the participant gave a response to the visual-search task, or after 20 s. In the dual-task condition, the auditory target was presented visually prior to the trial, and participants reported the digit count at the end of the trial. Feedback was provided only for the primary task.

Condition (dual- or single-task) was switched halfway the experiment. Condition order was counterbalanced between participants. The experiment consisted of 200 trials, preceded by 4 practice trials. 11 participants were recruited.

## Results

Trials lasted on average 12.2 ms. The average fixation duration was 246 ms. A total of 107,339 fixations were entered into the analysis. No participants or data points were excluded.

The analysis used for Exp. 1 and 2 was applied without modification to the data from the single- and dual task conditions (see Supplementary Methods for an interactive analysis). Crucially, pupil size was a significant additional predictor of fixation saliency in the single-task condition (X2(1) = 5.31, p = .020), but not in the dual-task condition (X2(1) = 2.67, p = .102). There was a partial relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency in the single-task condition (t = 2.56). (A partial relationship could not be estimated for the dual-task condition, because pupil size was not included in the preferred model.) The direct relationship was reliable in the single-task (t = 2.06), but not the dual-task condition (t = 1.23).

The difference between the single- and dual-task conditions is particularly striking in the temporal-displacement analysis (%FigExp3Window). The single-task condition is a perfect replication of Exp. 1 and 2, and shows a temporally diffuse window with the strongest (partial) relationship between pupil size at fixation `i+1` and saliency at fixation `i`. In contrast, the dual-task condition is a more-or-less flat line. This suggests that the results of the dual-task condition are not merely attenuated, but are qualitatively different from the single-task results. (For this analysis, the preferred model for the single-task condition was applied to the dual-task condition as well, because the preferred model for the dual-task condition did not include pupil size.)

Finally, an LME with condition as fixed effect, participant as random effect, and fixation saliency as dependent measure showed that participants fixated, on average, more salient locations in the dual-task (M = 15.3, SE = 0.206; arbitrary units) than in the single-task condition (M = 14.3, SE = 0.203, t = 3.57).

## Discussion

In summary, the single-task condition (visual-search only) in Exp. 3 replicates the negative relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency, including the temporally diffuse pattern with a peak relationship between pupil size at fixation `i+1` and saliency at fixation `i`. Crucially, in the dual-task condition, where the visual-search task was secondary, this relationship was much reduced, if not entirely absent. In addition, participants looked at more salient locations in the dual-task, compared to the single-task condition.

These results support our proposal that the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is mediated by mental effort. If participants perform only the visual-search task, pupil size reflects the amount of effort invested in goal-driven control of eye movements, and large pupils consequently predict fixations on low-salient locations. However, if the visual-search task is secondary, pupil size largely reflects the effort invested in the primary task, and large pupils no longer predict goal-driven eye movements.
