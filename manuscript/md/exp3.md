The aim of Exp. 3 was to test whether the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is related to general arousal, or, which we think is the more interesting possibility, to the effort that is invested specifically in eye-movement control. To this end, we compared a visual-search-only condition (cf. Exp. 1) with a dual-task condition, in which the same visual-search task was secondary to a digit-counting task.

The rationale is as follows. We assume that pupil size mostly reflects the mental effort that is invested in the primary task. Therefore, if visual search is secondary, a large pupil size should not be predictive of fixations on low-salient locations, or less so. Phrased differently, we predict a weaker relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency in the dual-task, compared to the single-task condition.

## Methods

The methods, stimuli, and procedure were similar to those of Exp. 1, with the following exceptions. Throughout each trial, a random auditory stream of digits (1-5) was presented with an inter-digit interval of 1500 ms. In the visual-search-only condition, participants ignored the auditory stream and searched for a small 'Z' or 'H' embedded in the image. In the dual-task condition, the visual-search task was secondary, and the primary task was to count the number of times that an auditory target was presented. We were not interested in the primary task per se, but it served to reduce the amount of mental effort in the visual-search task. In both conditions, the trial ended when the participant gave a response to the visual-search task, or after 20 s. In the dual-task condition, the auditory target was presented visually prior to the trial, and participants reported the digit count at the end of the trial. Feedback was provided only for the primary task.

Condition (dual- or single-task) was switched halfway the experiment. Condition order was varied between participants. The experiment consisted of 200 trials, preceded by 4 practice trials. 25 participants were recruited.

## Results

Trials lasted on average 16.1 s. The average fixation duration was 253 ms. Because on a small number of fixations there appeared to be recording artifacts resulting in very small pupil-size measures, we excluded fixations with a pupil size that deviated more than 3 SD from the mean pupil size (1.36 %). A total of 227,648 fixations were entered into the analysis.

First, we tested whether we replicated the relationship pupil size and fixation saliency, using the same analysis as for Exp. 1 and 2. The replication was successful (B = 0.67, SE = 0.18, t = 3.78).

Next, we tested whether our task manipulation modulated the strength of the relationship between pupil size and saliency. To do so, we used the same model as before, but added the pupil size x task interaction as fixed effect, as well as random slopes for task. This analysis revealed a reliable interaction in the expected direction, such that the relationship was more robust for the single-task than the dual-task condition (B = 0.43, SE = 0.18, t = 2.44). This was confirmed by separate analyses for the two tasks, which showed that the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency was about twice as strong in the single-task (B = 1.04, SE = 0.27, t = 3.89) than the dual-task condition (B = 0.46, SE = 0.17, t = 2.75).

The difference between the single- and dual-task conditions is particularly striking in the temporal-displacement analysis (%FigExp3Window), which is identical to the analyses presented in %FigExp12Window, but performed separately for the single- and dual-task conditions. This analysis shows clearly that the relationship between pupil size and saliency is reduced for all temporal displacements.

Finally, we tested whether performance on the visual-search task was impaired in the dual-task, compared with the single-task condition (i.e. whether participants did indeed invest mental effort in the auditory memory task). To do so, we conducted a linear mixed effects model with reaction time on the visual-search task as dependent variable, condition as fixed effect, and participant as random effect on the intercept and condition slope. This revealed a reliable effect of condition (B = -3.00, SE = 0.40, t = 7.58), such that participants responded more quickly in the single-task than in the dual-task condition.

## Discussion

In summary, the single-task condition (visual-search only) in Exp. 3 replicates the negative relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency, including the temporally diffuse pattern with a peak relationship between pupil size at fixation `i+1` and saliency at fixation `i`. Crucially, in the dual-task condition, where the visual-search task was secondary, this relationship was much reduced.

These results support our proposal that the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is mediated by mental effort. If participants perform only the visual-search task, pupil size reflects the amount of effort invested in goal-driven eye-movement control, and large pupils consequently predict fixations on low-salient locations. However, if the visual-search task is secondary, pupil size largely reflects the effort invested in the primary task, and large pupils no longer predict goal-driven eye movements.
