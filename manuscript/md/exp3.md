The aim of Exp. 3 was to test whether the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is related to general arousal, or--which we think is the more interesting possibility--to mental effort that is invested specifically in guiding the eyes towards relevant locations. To this end, we compared a visual-search-only condition (cf. Exp. 1) with a dual-task condition in which the same visual-search task was secondary to an auditory memory task.

The rationale is as follows. We assume that pupil size largely reflects the mental effort that is invested in the primary task. Therefore, if eye-movement control (i.e. visual search) is secondary, fluctuations in pupil size should not (only) reflect fluctuations in the effort that is invested in eye-movement control, and a large pupil should be less predictive of fixations on low-salient locations. Phrased differently, we predict a weaker relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency in the dual-task, compared to the single-task condition.

## Methods

The methods, stimuli, and procedure were similar to those of Exp. 1, with the following exceptions. Throughout each trial, a random auditory stream of digits (1-5) was presented with an inter-digit interval of 1500 ms. In the visual-search-only condition, participants ignored the auditory stream and searched for a small 'Z' or 'H' embedded in the image (cf. Exp. 1). In the dual-task condition, the visual-search task was secondary, and the primary task was to count the number of times that a specific auditory target was presented. We were not interested in the auditory memory task per se, but it served to reduce the amount of mental effort in the visual-search task. In both conditions, the trial ended when the participant gave a response to the visual-search task, or after 20 s. In the dual-task condition, the auditory target was presented visually prior to the trial, and participants reported the digit count at the end of the trial. Feedback was provided only for the primary task. The set-up was similar (but not identical) to those used for Exp. 1 and 2.

Condition (dual- or single-task) switched halfway the experiment. Condition order was randomly varied between participants. The experiment consisted of 200 trials, preceded by four practice trials. Twenty-five participants were recruited.

## Results

Trials lasted on average 16.1 s. The average fixation duration was 253 ms. Because on a small number of fixations there appeared to be recording artifacts resulting in very small pupil-size measures, we excluded fixations with a pupil size that deviated more than 3 SD from the mean pupil size (1.36 %). A total of 227,648 fixations were entered into the analysis. No participants were excluded.

First, we tested whether performance on the visual-search task was impaired in the dual-task, compared with the single-task condition (i.e. whether participants did indeed invest mental effort in the auditory memory task). To do so, we conducted an LME model with reaction time on the visual-search task as dependent variable, condition as fixed effect, and by-participant random intercept and condition slopes. This revealed a reliable effect of condition in the expected direction (*β* = -3.00, SE = 0.40, t = 7.58): Participants responded about 3 s faster in the single-task than in the dual-task condition.

For the pupil-size analysis, we used the same analysis as for Exp. 1 and 2, but added the pupil size x condition interaction as fixed effect, as well as by-participant random slopes for condition. This analysis revealed a reliable interaction in the expected direction, such that the relationship was more robust for the single-task than the dual-task condition (*β* = 0.43, SE = 0.18, t = 2.44). The relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency (i.e. *β*) was about twice as strong in the single-task (*β* = 0.95) than the dual-task condition (*β* = 0.52).

The difference between the single- and dual-task conditions is particularly striking in the temporal-displacement analysis (%FigExp3Window), which is identical to the analyses presented in %FigExp12Window, but performed separately for the single- and dual-task conditions. This analysis shows clearly that in the dual-task condition the relationship between pupil size and saliency is consistently reduced for all temporal displacements.

## Discussion

The single-task condition (visual-search only) in Exp. 3 replicates the negative relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency observed in Exp. 1 and 2, including the temporally diffuse pattern with a peak relationship between pupil size at fixation *i*+1 and fixation saliency at fixation *i*. Crucially, in the dual-task condition, where the visual-search task was secondary, this relationship was much reduced.

These results support our proposal that the relationship between pupil size and fixation saliency is mediated by mental effort. When participants performed only the visual-search task, pupil size reflected the amount of effort that was invested in goal-driven eye-movement control, and large pupils therefore predicted fixations on low-salient locations. However, when the visual-search task was secondary, and pupil size partly, if not largely, reflected the effort invested in the primary task (auditory memory), large pupils became a much weaker predictor of goal-driven eye movements.
