Here we report that large pupils predict fixations of the eye on low-salient, inconspicuous parts of a visual scene. We interpret this as showing that mental effort, reflected by pupillary dilation, is required to guide gaze towards objects that are relevant to current goals, but may not be very salient. When mental effort is low, reflected by a pupillary constriction, the eyes tend to be captured by high-salient parts of the image, irrespective of top-down goals. The relationship between pupil size and visual saliency was not driven by luminance, nor a range of other factors that we considered. In addition, this relationship arises only when mental effort is invested specifically in the eye-movement task, and is not due to overall levels of arousal. Our finding illustrates that goal-driven control during scene viewing requires mental effort, and that pupil size can be used as an on-line measure to track the goal-drivenness of behavior.
