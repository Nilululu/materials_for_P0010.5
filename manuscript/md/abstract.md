Here we report that large pupils predict fixations of the eye on low-salient, inconspicuous parts of a visual scene. We interpret this as showing that mental effort, reflected by a dilation of the pupil, is required to guide gaze towards objects that are relevant to current goals, but may not be very salient. When mental effort is low, reflected by a constriction of the pupil, the eyes tend to be captured by high-salient parts of the image, irrespective of top-down goals. The relationship between pupil size and visual saliency was not driven by luminance, nor a range of other factors that we considered. In addition, the relationship arose only when mental effort was invested specifically in the eye-movement task, and was therefore not related to general arousal. Our finding illustrates that goal-driven control during scene viewing requires mental effort, and that pupil size can be used as an on-line measure to track the goal-drivenness of behavior.
