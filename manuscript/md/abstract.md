Here we report that large pupils predict fixations of the eye on low-salient, inconspicuous parts of a visual scene. We interpret this as showing that mental effort, reflected by a dilation of the pupil, is required to guide gaze towards objects that are relevant to current goals, but may not be very salient. In the absence of mental effort, reflected by a relative constriction of the pupil, the eyes tend to be captured by high-salient parts of the image, irrespective of top-down goals. The relationship between pupil size and visual saliency was not driven by luminance, nor a range of other factors that we considered. Our finding illustrates that mental effort influences the ability to exert goal-driven control during scene viewing, and that pupil size can be used to track the goal-drivenness of eye movements from one fixation to the next.
