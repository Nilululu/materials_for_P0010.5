Eye movements are guided to a considerable extent by the environment. Imagine a single bright cloud that stands out saliently against an otherwise clear sky. The cloud has edges and other non-uniformities that trigger a response in your visual system [@ArcizetMirpourBisley2011]. In contrast, the homogeneously blue sky excites the visual system very little. As a result, your gaze is likely to fall on the cloud. Not because it is particularly worthy of your attention, but simply because the cloud is the only salient object and therefore 'captures' your eyes. But now let us imagine that you want to spot the moon in the day sky. The moon can be very difficult to see in daylight, and has little of the properties that render the bright cloud so salient. At best, the moon is a small disc that is slightly discolored relative to the surrounding blue sky. Therefore, to find the moon, you have to steer your eyes away from the cloud and towards other parts of the sky, which are less salient, but may contain the moon. This is a tug of war between your 'top-down' goal to find the moon, and the 'bottom-up' tendency for your eyes to be captured by the salient cloud.

Theories differ in the relative importance that they assign to top-down and bottom-up factors in daily-life guidance of eye movements. Some authors propose a strong bottom-up view [@IttiKoch2001;@Theeuwes2010Acta], whereas others favor a large role for top-down goals [@FolkRemingtonJohnston1992;@HendersonBrockmoleCastelhanoMack2007;@Zelinsky2008]. Yet, despite their differences, most theories agree that some mixture of top-down goals and bottom-up saliency guides our eyes [see also @TatlerBaddeleyGilchrist2005]. Therefore, the crucial question is: Which factors determine whether top-down or bottom-up factors prevail in a particular situation?

Van Zoest, Donk, and Theeuwes [-@Van+zoestDonkTheeuwes2004]+[; see also @DonkVan+zoest2008;@SieboldVan+zoestDonk2011;@Van+zoestDonk2005;@Van+zoestDonk2006;@Van+zoestDonk2008] addressed this question by considering the time-course of visual selection. In one experiment [Exp. 4; @Van+zoestDonkTheeuwes2004], participants searched for a pre-specified target, which was a line-segment tilted 45° from a vertical orientation. The target was embedded in a field of homogeneous vertical line-segments. In addition, a distractor was presented, which was also a tilted line-segment. Crucially, the distractor was either more salient than the target, equally salient, or less salient. The results were clear-cut. Very fast eye movements (with a latency of less than 250 ms) overwhelmingly landed on the most salient object, regardless of whether it was the target or the distractor. In contrast, slow eye movements were usually directed at the target stimulus, regardless of the saliency of the distractor. This suggests that fast eye movements are driven primarily by bottom-up saliency, whereas slow eye movements are driven primarily by top-down goals.

The findings of Van Zoest and colleagues [-@Van+zoestDonkTheeuwes2004]+[; @DonkVan+zoest2008;@SieboldVan+zoestDonk2011;@Van+zoestDonk2005;@Van+zoestDonk2006;@Van+zoestDonk2008]+[; see also @GodijnTheeuwes2002] suggest that bottom-up saliency is dominant in guiding the eyes 'early on' (i.e. for very fast eye movements and/ or immediately after a stimulus has appeared), but that top-down goals become dominant later in time [@FoulshamUnderwood2007;@HendersonMalcolmSchandl2009]. What we propose here is that 'mental effort' is required to exert top-down control. We use the term mental effort in connection with the pupillometry literature [cf. @Beatty1982], but what we suggest specifically is the following. It is computationally non-trivial to evaluate visual input in terms of top-down goals, because goals are abstract concepts that cannot be mapped directly onto visual features [except relatively simple goals, such as "looking for something red", cf. @Wolfe1994]. Presumably, this process takes time [cf. @Van+zoestDonkTheeuwes2004] and requires feedback loops between the early visual system and higher-order parietal and frontal areas [@LammeRoelfsema2000]. In this sense, mental effort is required, even though the computations that underlie top-down guidance may be wholly or partly implicit. Crucially, the amount of effort that we invest in eye-movement guidance is likely to fluctuate over time. For example, participants in a search-for-Waldo experiment [e.g., @KleinMacinnes1999] may initially invest a lot of effort in trying to find Waldo. But over the course of many trials drowsiness sets in and effort wanes. At this point, participants let their eyes glaze over the image, from one conspicuous element to the next, no longer engaging the top-down goal to find Waldo.

Mental effort, as we have described it above, is easily measured. As numerous studies have shown, the pupil faithfully dilates when you engage in a task that in some way requires mental effort [for a recent review, see @LaengSiroisGredebäck2012]+[; for a classic, but remarkably insightful review, see @Loewenfeld1958]: The seminal studies by @KahnemanBeatty1966 have shown that the pupil dilates as a result of increased working memory load; Pupil dilation indicates the amount of effort invested in speech comprehension [@ZekveldKramerFesten2010]; More recently, and more directly related to the present study, it has been shown that pupillary dilation accompanies the detection of a target in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm [@PriviteraRenningerCarneyKleinAguilar2010], and that pupil-size indicates search difficulty in a visual search task [@PorterTrosciankoGilchrist2007].

In the present experiments, we measured pupil size while participants viewed an image and made unconstrained eye movements. Across three experiments, we consistently found that the pupil was relatively dilated, reflecting increased mental effort [cf. @Beatty1982;@KahnemanBeatty1966;@ZekveldKramerFesten2010], when participants fixated on low-salient locations. We interpret this finding as showing that top-down control in eye-movement guidance relies on mental effort. Without mental effort, the eyes are captured by high-salient objects, regardless of whether these are relevant to current goals.
